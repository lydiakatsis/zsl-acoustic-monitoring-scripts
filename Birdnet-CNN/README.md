## Outline ##

This script runs the BirdNet algorithm developed by Kahl et al., 2021. It processes multiple files in parallel (number determined by the number of threads you select), and runs the BirdNet algorithm on the files. 

Results are output to csv's for each file in the results directory.

The final line of the script concatenates all the results csv's into one.
